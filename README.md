# RoadNetworks
Routable OSM road network graph, road network model and dynamic visualisation using AWT from .pbf files. Below I show some screen shots of my dynamic visualisation which provides functionalities such as pan and zoom. Note that all scripts are written in Java 8.

# Snap to road
Some of my work on snap to road algorithms i.e. Map matching

# LMA
Some of my attempts at using apache math for simple optimisation problems

# MABMain
I have also thrown in a very simple implementation of multi-armed-bandit code which uses epsilon greedy approach for exploration vs exploitation.
